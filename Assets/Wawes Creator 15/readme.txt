Congratulations on your purchase!

To get started, you just need to run the file with a resolution *.unity in the root directory asset.

Having dealt with the shading on prefabs you can use it in your personal development.
To do this, you simply drag the script supply in the asset to your object.

To see the animation without texturing set the "wireframe" editor mode.
To change the type of waves is recommended to change the value of "Wawes Mode" in the range of from 0.1 to 1.

Sincerely, 
sTauri Interactive!
